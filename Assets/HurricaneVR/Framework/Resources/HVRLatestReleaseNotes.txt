Release 2.1

Teleporting:
	HVRTeleportCollisionHandler: Will attempt to prevent hand and held objects from being stuck inside defined collision layers after teleporting. 
	Teleport handling code for moving held objects with the player in HVRPlayerController has been removed and moved to this component.
	
	AfterTeleportOptions: 
		TeleportDefault - does nothing 
		BoundingBoxSweep - bounding box of grabbable colliders will be used to detect overlap after teleport.
		DisableCollision - grabbable object collision is disabled and hand cannot drop object until clear.
	
	New HVRTeleportOptions component that can bee added to grabbable objects.
		BeforeTeleportOptions: optionally block teleporting, or to force a release of the object pre teleport.
		AfterTeleportOptions: per grabbable override of collision handler options.
			TeleportDefault - uses HVRTeleportCollisionHandler setting
			
	Rig prefabs have been updated with the new component.
			

HVRHandPoser - VRIK hand position / rotation mirroring is now supported for standard rigs and can be enabled / disabled on HVRSettings:IKHandMirroring.
Non standard rigs such as the VRIK Pilot require additional "Match Rotation" settings, setup on the HVRPosableHand component, see the Pilot poser prefab 
as an example.

HVRHandPoserEditor - updated to handle deprecated onSelectionChanged method in the latest Unity versions.

New Tech Demo Guns and Gun Creator: 
	If you created guns using the new gun editor you will want to re-enable gravity on the stabilizer grabbable rigidbody.
	The Gun Editor has been updated to not disable gravity on newly created guns.
	Stabilizer grabbables on the example gun prefabs have had gravity re-enabled on them

HVRPosableGrabPoint:
	Fixed a hand offset issue when IsJointAnchor was checked.

HexaBody Integration - fixed missing easy collider creator hulls on the elevator locker object



Release 2.0.5

Fixed an issue with the teleporter which was causing the physics hands to jump after teleporting when Update / Fixed are out of sync.
Updated Oculus Integration rig for previous CameraRig calibration release 


Release 2.0.4

Removed CCBY attribution models due to Unity no longer allowing them to be included in the asset.
Due to this the vanilla example scene no longer has the old dagger / sword / m4a1 / pistol / shotgun / hammer. 
Refer to the new Tech Demo scene for gun, sword, and hammer examples.
The FinalIK and HexaBodyVR integrations are updated to handle this change.


Release 2.0.3
-HVRGunBase OnHit method is now overridable
-Fixed garbage being allocated by the HVRStabTracker component
-Optimized velocity tracking code in HVRGrabbable
-Fixed some GC allocation in HVRHandAnimator:ApplyBlend function
-Fixed HVRCameraRig default scale value to 1 which was affect crouch until a manual calibration occured.
-HVRCameraRig CalibrateHeightOnStart will now wait for Camera movement before calibrating
-HVRPhysicsButton press check will use distance along axis instead of only distance to prevent button presses from unstable joints 

HexaBody Integration
 New tech demo scene with some bw style puzzling and parkour, world's tallest slippery slide, smooth elevator, settings and calibration UI, and gravity suction cups!
 Requires the TechDemo assets from HurricaneVR.

Release 2.0.2
-Fixed Gun Creator Editor not setting magazine grag / hover eject colliders as a trigger
-Fixed Gun Creator to add the eject direction transform and link to magazine socket field for eject animation direction
-Fixed Bullet Trail Line Renderer to be behind and not in front of the transform

Release 2.0.1

Fixed up Pump Shotgun prefab to behave a little more like a shotgun when it comes to ejecting shells
Fixed an issue with the door where it wouldn't require handle rotation after being unlocked the first time

TechDemo Scene Updated with UI for Locomotion Options and Sit / Stand and Height Calibration demonstration
SteamVRController now use haptics action for playing haptics instead of legacy XR which might not work in build mode for steam devices.

New Sitting / Standing Mode Enhancements	
HVRCameraRig:
	-CameraScale : Transform field for scaling when in Standing Mode, the camera and tracked controller transforms should become a child of this transform
	-PlayerHeight : The height of the virtual player to base camera offsets and scaling from
	-SitStanding : Enum with 3 modes
		Sitting: Height Calibration will boost the Camera to this height
		Standing: Height Calibration will scale the 'CameraScale' transform based on the 'PlayerHeight' and Camera Height at time of calibration.
		PlayerHeight: will behave has normal with no scaling or camera offsetting.
	
		
Rig prefabs updated with CameraScale transform setup

Release 2.0

Fixes:
-Hands should no longer try to reach world 0,0,0 upon start, which might happen the further the player starts from 0,0,0
-HVRDestroyListener component that is added to a grab point on grab should now be properly destroyed upon release
-Hot fix for a interpolation bug in Unity where parenting a kinematic rigidbody with interpolate on would cause the object to not follow the parent accurately
-Fixed a bug in the hexabody physics hand integration where grabbing the same climbable object with both hands and then releasing one would reset the hand strength
	when the climbing hand strength should remain active while held.
-Fixed and issue where buttons on scroll view could not be clicked when using the included UI Input Module.
-SFXPlayer : no longer changes the name of the pooled audio source to the sfx clip it's playing by default as using gameobject.name allocates garbage.
-HVRTriggerGrabbableBag : updated to use TryGetComponent to reduce garbage allocation while in editor mode.
-HVRGrabbableBag: no longer listens for grabbable destroy events to save unnessecary garbage allocation.
-TeleportMarker fbx moved from samples to framework/models, prefab updated to use new fbx file
-Teleport laser line should not long jitter

New Escape Room style Tech Demo Scene included with all new models, textures, and sfx that you can use in your games if you wish.
-Physics door example with SFX
-Rotation tracker examples
-Physics drawer examples with SFX
-New weapon examples
-Physics button examples with events
-Socket examples with events
-Joint rotation limiter > 180 degrees example 


New Gun Components:
-The old gun components are now deprecated and will no longer receive updates and will be removed in a future update. 	

HVRGunBase: new base component for guns to derive from.
HVRCockingHandle: handles reciprocating, non reciprocating, and pump shotgun style cocking handles.
HVRAutoDropMagazine: HVRSocket extension used to remove magazine from the gun when a new magazine is near.
HVRGrabMagazine: dummy grabbable used to grab a magazine from a gun cleanly, helpful to give non input options to remove a magazine.
HVRMagazineSocket: specialized socket used to animate the loading and ejection of magazines.
HVRGunEmmiterBase : new base component for emitting bullets and casings
HVRPooledEmitter: Object pool emitter for bullets and casings
HVRShotgun : new class for new gun system
HVRBulletEmitter: emits bullet prefabs that remain in the world
HVRTriggerAnimator : animates the trigger based on trigger pull amount
HVRGunBolt : animated gun part 

New Gun Editor Window:
New Editor window that will take a template gun prefab and create all of the necessary objects and components and link them together for you.

New Components:
HVRRigidbodyLocker: helps lock joints into position and rotation on locked axis
HVRRotationSFX:	can use HVRRotationTracker to play sfx based on angle changes


	
Teleporting Updates: (Default Rig prefabs updated) Users that modified the teleport will need to revisit and setup the teleport marker.
-HVRTeleporter re-written with subclassing in mind.
-New Bezier Line Curve option
-Max teleport angle option to limit height
-Optional Destination line of sight checks
-Optional line of sight to teleport line origin check
-Optional drop distance check
-Optional jump distance check
-TeleportableLayers field to define layers that you can teleport onto
-Valid / Invalid colors of the line renderer now set in the inspector
-Capsule field added for non character controller based checks.
-Added HVRTeleportMarkerBase and HVRTeleportMarker components for custom destination markers.
-Added HVRInvalidTeleport component that can be added to gameobjects to disallow teleporting 

-HVRPlayerController added 'DirectionStyle' to control the player direction with Camera, LeftController, or RightController
-HVRHandPoser: animation parameter changed to text field instead of drop down populated from HVRSettings
-HVRPhysicsDoor: added sfx for closing and opening
-HVRPhysicsDrawer : added sfx for closing and opening
-HVRHandGrabber : default throw bonus factor set to 0 from 1
-HVRGrabbable : default angular to linear throw factor set to 0 from 1

Layers:
LeftTarget and RightTarget have been collapsed into a single layer 'DynamicPose', the position of this layer does not matter, nor does it require any
	consideration in the collision matrix or for line of sight checks. 
	Be sure to add this layer after updating. The layer setup helper tool will replace this for you. 
	The layer helper tool will now pop up a message box with a report of the layer setup process.
